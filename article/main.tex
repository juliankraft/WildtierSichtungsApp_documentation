\begin{abstract}
The aim of this semester project is to assess the accessability of the technology to create a web application to record geo tagged data.
With the help of modern web frameworks, a web application was built to record wildlife sightings. A working prototype was created and and made
available online with the option to install it on smartphones of all major operating systems.
The project was a success and the technology is accessible to everyone with a bit more than basic programming knowledge and maybe some help.
